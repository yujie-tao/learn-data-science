## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


My First R Markdown file
===========================


This is my first R markdown file.

Here, we're going to load some data

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
summary(airquality)
```

Let's first make a pairs plot of th data

``` {r}
paris(airquality)
```

Here is a regression model of ozone, on wind, solar rediation, and temperature

``` {r}
library(stats)
fit <- lm(Ozone-Wind + Solar.R + Temp, data = airquality)
summary(fit)
```
